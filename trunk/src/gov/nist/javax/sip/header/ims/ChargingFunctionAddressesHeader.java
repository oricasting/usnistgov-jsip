/**
 * P-Charging-Function-Addresses header
 * Private Header: RFC 3455. 
 * 
 * There is a need to inform each SIP proxy involved in a transaction about the common
 * charging functional entities to receive the generated charging records or charging events.
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 *   - CCF is used for off-line charging (e.g., for postpaid account charging).
 * <li>
 *   - ECF is used for on-line charging (e.g., for pre-paid account charging).
 * </ul>
 * Only one instance of the header MUST be present in a particular request or response.
 * 
 * <pre>
 * P-Charging-Addr = "P-Charging-Function-Addresses" HCOLON
 *			charge-addr-params
 *			*(SEMI charge-addr-params)
 * charge-addr-params	= ccf / ecf / generic-param
 * ccf 		        = "ccf" EQUAL gen-value
 * ecf 			= "ecf" EQUAL gen-value
 *
 *
 * example: 
 *  P-Charging-Function-Addresses: ccf=192.1.1.1; ccf=192.1.1.2; 
 *	ecf=192.1.1.3; ecf=192.1.1.4

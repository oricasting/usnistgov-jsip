This is the root of the JAIN implementation of SIP. Contains utility
classes and implementatin of the provider and stack. Implementation of the
headers is contained in header and implementation of the parser in the
parser subdirectory. The stack contains the implementation classes for
the stack. The StackImpl here implements the Jain SIP stack. The dialog
and transaction implementations reside in the stack package.

Additional Features (that are not required by the JAIN-SIP spec) and that
can be enabled by properties specified when the SipStack is created:

<ul>
<li> Message Logging features - permits the application to log messages in
a format that are suitable for trace viewing using the trace viewer facility.  
</li>
<li> Load Control Features - Control the transaction table size and server 
conurrency to lessen Denial of Service attacks.
</li>
</ul>

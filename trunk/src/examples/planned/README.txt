This directory contains planned additions for jain-sip 1.2. It is provided
here to encourage you to give us feedback about these additions.

These additions will include the following:

1. Enhancements to the Dialog package to allow applications to explicitly 
   control dialog creation.

2. Allow a stack to support multiple IP addresses (associate IP address with
   listening point).

3. Add a Network Layer to allow applications explicit access to the
   underlying Socket abstactions used by the Stack.

Ranga.

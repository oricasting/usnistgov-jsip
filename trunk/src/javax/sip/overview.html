<h2>This document specifies the JSIP API Specification v1.2.</h2>    

<h2>Objective<br>
    </h2>
     
<p>The objective of this specification is to develop a standard interface
  to the&nbsp; Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) that can be used independently 
 or by higher level programming entities and environments. This specification 
 was designed to provide a developer with a standardized interface for SIP
  services which are functionally compatible with the RFC3261 specification.
   This specification is a general purpose transaction based Java interface 
 to the SIP protocol. It is rich both semantically and in definition to the 
 SIP protocol. <br>
   </p>
     
<h2>Design approach </h2>
     
<p>JSIP supports RFC 3261 functionality and the following SIP extensions; 
 the INFO method (RFC 2976), Reliability of provisional responses (RFC 3262), 
 Event Notification Framework (RFC 3265), the UPDATE method (RFC 3311), the 
 Reason Header (RFC 3326), the Message method (RFC 3428) defined for instant 
 messaging and the REFER method (RFC 3515), Distributing Authoritative Name 
Servers via Shared Unicast Addresses (RFC 3581). </p>
     
<p>JSIP standardizes the interface to the generic transactional model 
 defined by the SIP protocol, providing access to dialog functionality from 
 the transaction interface. The architecture is developed for the J2SE environment 
 therefore is event based utilizing the Listener/Provider event model. The 
 specification is asynchronous in nature using transactional identifiers to
 correlate messages. It defines various factory classes for creating Request 
 and Response messages and SIP headers.&nbsp; JSIP defines an interface 
 for each Header supported, which can be added to Request or Response messages 
 respectively. These messages are passed to the SipProvider with a transaction 
 to be sent onto the network, while the SipListener listens for incoming Events
 that encapsulate messages that may be responses to initiated dialogs or
new  incoming dialogs.</p>
     
<p>JSIP is extensible by design. It defines a generic extension header 
 interface that can be used by applications that utilize headers that are 
not supported directly by JSIP. The design also defines a mechanism to 
support future dialog creation methods in a JSIP environment via the use
of Java Properties. JSIP can be managed statically with regards to IP
addresses and router function, and dynamically specific to ports and transports.&nbsp;</p>
     
<p>JSIP applications may be stateless, dialog stateful or transaction
 stateful components such as stateful proxy servers ( without being dialog stateful ).
 The default handling of message retransmissions in JSIP is dependent 
 on the application. All retransmissions are handled by the
 stack for user agents (ie. dialog stateful applications).

<h2>Specification Leads</h2>
 Phelim O'Doherty, BEA Systems Inc.<br>
 Mudumbai Ranganathan, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST),
  Advanced Networking Technologies Division. 
<p> The specification leads would like to acknowledge effort and
contributions to the JSIP specification from 8x8, dynamicsoft, HP, IBM, Nortel
 Networks, Open Cloud, Radvision, Siemens AG, Sun Microsystems.

<p> Version 1.2 benifitted greatly by input from the following individuals: 
Jeroen van Bemmel (Lucent) and Sarit Galanos (Radvision). 
The specification leads gratefully acknowledge their contributions 
and those of the user community in ironing out the fine details. 
Jeroen van Bemmel identified and fixed several bugs in the
RI and helped implement some TCK tests.</p>
 
<p>Special thanks is given to  the development team at the NIST. 
This specification owes a lot to their  commitment in developing 
the Reference Implementation and Technology  Compatibility Kit (TCK). 
Emil Ivov from Louis Pasteur University, France helped develop the Technology
Compatibility Kit for version 1.1 of this specification which was evolved
into the TCK for V 1.2. 
<p>
The specification leads would like to thank the Advanced
Networking  Technologies Division (NIST) for their support in placing
the Reference Implementation in the public domain and making accessible 
in source code for the people, thus encouraging adoption and evolution 
of this standard. </p>

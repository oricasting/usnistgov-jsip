JAIN-SIP 1.1 Reference Implementation
--------------------------------------
CONTENTS
-------
See docs/index.html

BUILD Notes
-----------
Platforms:
---------
You need to install J2SDK 1.3 or above. 1.41 is highly recommended. You can
get J2SDK from http://www.javasoft.com

Nist-sip1.2 compiles and runs on Ipaq using the Blackdown jvm (1.3
compatible) running on top of Familiar (Linux embedded operating
system). To add Swing support,  you just need to install an optional
library. 

The jsphone example requires J2SDK1.4 and Java Media Framework (JMF).

Building It from Scratch
-------------------------
The distribution is pre-built but should you feel inclined to make changes,
or run the examples, you may wish to rebuild everything.

Using the makefile: 

1. edit build-config
2. make all

Building the TCK
----------------
1. Ensure that the junit library is present in lib/junit/junit.jar
2. Build the RI as above.
3. make tck (builds a jar file containing the TCK).
4. to run the TCK 

java -jar jain-sip-1.1.tck.jar -mode gui

Brings up a GUI and allows you to enter the path to your implementation.

Using Jakarta ant

You can use Forte with the provided build.xml file or download ant from
the apache website and use it directly. We use make as the build tool of
choice. build.xml is not always up to date.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Running the examples

Please ensure that the directory  classes  (relative to where you have
built the distribution) is included in the  classpath.  Makefile targets
and shell scripts  are provided in each example directory to run the
examples.

How to get Source Code Refreshes
--------------------------------

CVS Snapshot
------------

For those who cannot access CVS thanks to paranoid administrative policies, 
here is a HTTP url where a nightly source only snapshot is grabbed from
the stable CVS repository and dumped:

http://is2.antd.nist.gov/pub/nist-sip/nist-sip-1.2.src.tar.gz 

http://is2.antd.nist.gov/pub/nist-sip/nist-sip-1.2.src.zip 

To build from this snapshot you need to grab the xerces library from
apache and install it in the lib/xerces directory. If you started with
the tar/zip file, just untar/unzip the source and you will overwrite
the existing distribution.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
CVS Access
----------

The "stable" cvs reposiotory is located on java.net. To download from CVS
(higly recommended), visit 

http://jain-sip.dev.java.net/source/browse/jain-sip/

And follow the instructions there.



----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The BLEEDING EDGE repository 
----------------------------

Because we frequently collaborate with others,  we also have a public
internal CVS repository.  We use this for our own development as well.
This is referred to affectionately as the BLEEDING EDGE repository.
Use our internal CVS repository if you want to be on the bleeding edge
of development but be warned that  the code herein is likely to be
less stable but more up to date and therefore more or less buggy as the
case may be (consider the principle of "no risk no reward"):

cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@is2.antd.nist.gov:/home/nist-sip/cvs-nist-sip-1.2/repository  login

password: nist-sip

Check the source out:

cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@is2.antd.nist.gov:/home/nist-sip/cvs-nist-sip-1.2/repository  checkout nist-sip-1.2

Update what you have checked out using the -P and -d flags 
(-P prunes empty directories and -d adds new ones).

cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@is2.antd.nist.gov:/home/nist-sip/cvs-nist-sip-1.2/repository  update -d -P nist-sip-1.2 


----------------------------------------------------------------------------

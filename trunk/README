--------------------------------------
CONTENTS

See docs/index.html

BUILD Notes
-----------
Platforms:
---------
You need to install 1.3 or above. 1.5 is highly recommended. You can
get J2SDK from http://www.javasoft.com

compiles and runs on Ipaq using the Blackdown jvm (1.3
compatible) running on top of Familiar (Linux embedded operating
system). To add Swing support,  you just need to install an optional
library. 

With a few changes, this distribution can be made to compile and run 
on Personal Java.


Dependencies
------------

1. You need to install ant and the junit extension for ant on your machine.
2. You need to have junit.jar in your classpath.
3. You need to put concurrent.jar (included in the distribution) in your
    classpath.
4. You need to have log4j.jar in your classpath (included in this distribution).

There are versions of the dependent libraries in the lib directory. 

Building It from Scratch
-------------------------
The distribution is pre-built but should you feel inclined to make changes,
or run the examples, you may wish to rebuild everything.

ant make 

Builds everything.


Building the TCK
----------------

Edit tck.properties and set the claspath to your implementation.

ant runtck 

(builds a jar file containing the TCK and runs it).

Look in test-reports  to see the results of your run.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Running the examples

Please ensure that the directory  classes  (relative to where you have
built the distribution) is included in the  classpath. Ant targets
are provided in each example directory to run the examples.

How to get Source Code Refreshes
--------------------------------

CVS Snapshot
------------

For those who cannot access CVS thanks to draconian, idiotic or paranoid 
administrative policies, here is a HTTP url where a cruise control  
snapshot is grabbed from the stable CVS repository and dumped:

http://download.java.net/communications/jain-sip/nightly/



----------------------------------------------------------------------------
CVS Access
----------

The "stable" cvs reposiotory is located on java.net. To download from CVS
(higly recommended), visit 

http://jain-sip.dev.java.net/



And follow the instructions there. 


You can browse the source code online here:

http://jain-sip.dev.java.net/source/browse/jain-sip/


Note that you need to be logged in to java.net in order to acces the source 
from cvs.

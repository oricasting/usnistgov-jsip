JAIN-SIP 1.1 Reference Implementation
--------------------------------------
CONTENTS
-------
See docs/index.html

BUILD Notes
-----------
Platforms:
---------
You need to install J2SDK 1.3 or above. 1.41 is highly recommended. You can
get J2SDK from http://www.javasoft.com

Nist-sip1.2 compiles and runs on Ipaq using the Blackdown jvm (1.3
compatible) running on top of Familiar (Linux embedded operating
system). To add Swing support,  you just need to install an optional
library. 


Building It from Scratch
-------------------------
The distribution is pre-built but should you feel inclined to make changes,
or run the examples, you may wish to rebuild everything.

Using the makefile: 

1. edit build-config
2. make all

Building the TCK
----------------
The tck needs junit.jar
1. Build the RI as above.
2. make tck (builds a jar file containing the TCK).
3. to run the TCK 

java -jar jain-sip-1.1.tck.jar -mode gui

Brings up a GUI and allows you to enter the path to your implementation.

Using Jakarta ant (get it from the apache web site).

You can the provided build.xml file.
We use make as the build tool of choice. 
build.xml is not always up to date.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Running the examples

Please ensure that the directory  classes  (relative to where you have
built the distribution) is included in the  classpath.  Makefile targets
and shell scripts  are provided in each example directory to run the
examples.

How to get Source Code Refreshes
--------------------------------

CVS Snapshot
------------

For those who cannot access CVS thanks to paranoid administrative policies, 
here is a HTTP url where a nightly source only snapshot is grabbed from
the stable CVS repository and dumped:

http://is2.antd.nist.gov/pub/nist-sip/nist-sip-1.2.src.tar.gz 

http://is2.antd.nist.gov/pub/nist-sip/nist-sip-1.2.src.zip 


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
CVS Access
----------

The "stable" cvs reposiotory is located on java.net. To download from CVS
(higly recommended), visit 

http://jain-sip.dev.java.net/source/browse/jain-sip/

And follow the instructions there. 
Note that you need to be logged in to java.net in order to acces the source 
from cvs.

Architecture / API design:
-------------------------

JAIN-SIP:  Phelim O'Doherty (Sun Microsystems) and M. Ranganathan (NIST) 
JAIN-SDP: The SDP API spec lead is Kelvin Porter from DynamicSoft.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
M. Ranganathan's layman interpretation of the preceeding blather
----------------------------------------------------------------

This is public domain code. Do whatever you want with this software.
That means you can incorporate it into any product you wish or use it
as-is free of any royalty payments or license agreements.  You may not sue
us (that includes me) even if it has bugs and does not work as advertised.
NIST (ie. the public - including you and I but neither you nor I) owns
this software.  You may not grab ownership and get in the way of its
free distribution even if you invest a lot of effort into fixing it.
This is despite the fact that as it is in the public domain, you already
own it. Once you own something, you own something and you may not own
it again.  The software will remain in the public domain for now and ever
more (ie. until the sun shall shine and stars shall twinkle in the sky)
regardless of your use of it. Please be nice and acknowledge our efforts
if you find this code to be of use.

Such is the logic of the non-legal mind. Nuff said! have fun with it.

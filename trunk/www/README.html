<h2> Top contributors </h2>

Substantial code contributions made by the following people:

<ul>
<li> Emil Ivov <emil_ivov@yahoo.com> Contributed a Video Softphone Under GPL.
	This is currently hosted as an independent project 
	sip-communicator.dev.java.net

<li> Emil Ivov contributed the TCK for the Transaction and Dialog layer - this
	is over 75% of the TCK itself. 

<li> Jeff Keyser  Contributed the initial version of the Transaction layer 
	to NIST-SIP 1.1 that served as the basis for NIST-SIP 1.2. 
	Jeff also suggested the architecture for MessageProcessors and 
	extensiblity that is a part of the implementation architecture.
</ul>

<h2> Acknowledgements </h2>

<ul>
<li>
Marc Bednarek and Christophe Chazeau were guest researchers at NIST when
NIST-SIP 1.0 and NIST-SIP 1.1 were in development. Their contributions
are acknowledged.
<li>
The JAIN-SIP 1.1 API design is largely based on the NIST implementation
experiences of JAIN-SIP 1.0. The help of Chris Harris from DynamicSoft
(Spec Lead for JAIN-SIP 1.0) in understanding JAIN-SIP 1.0 is hereby
acknowledged. Implementing JAIN-SIP-1.0 was a great learning experience.
Hopefully our hindsight is good.
</ul>

<p> Design contributions to JAIN SIP 1.1 API were made by:

<ul>
<li> Brian O'Neill and Josh Burger (currently at bvoice).

<li> Dave Ferry and Ben Evans  from  Open Cloud inc. 

<li> Brad Templeton suggested that Dialog.sendBye be changed to the more 
generally useful Dialog.sendRequest. 

<li>
Emil Ivov, Brad Templeton and others requested a method to create a cancel
and Ack request for a client transaction and consequently 
ClientTransaction.createCancel  was added to the API.

</ul>

<p>
Bug Reports and enhancements for NIST-SIP 1.2 were contributed 
by the following people:

<ul>
<li> Brad Templeton noticed bugs in the Transaction/Dialog layer
   Brad suggested that Dialog.sendBye be changed to a more general
   Dialog.sendRequest Brad templeton noticed that the stack was
   sending out a Trying immediately and thereby not giving the application
   a chance to do so.

<li> Emil Ivov Contributed IPV6 Support. Emil Cotributed the Video Softphone
    under GPL Licensing. (See acknowledgement above). Emil noticed spec
    documentation bugs.  Emil uncovered bugs in the transaction layer
    implementation for several corner cases. Emil and Iain Macdonnell from 
    Sun reported a problem with SDP parsing. Emil discovered a bug in the
    Server transaction implementation. Emil contributed comprehensive 
    state machine unit tests of the Transaction layer to the TCK 
    (work in progress). 

<li> Andreas Byström reported bugs in set/get methods for Authentication 
    headers (quotes were missing). Andreas reported bugs in the 
    SDP implementation. Andreas helped to unit test call flows.  Andreas
    found documentation bugs and reported problems and incompleteness with
    the TCK.  Andreas noticed problems with Acking 487. Ack should be sent
    before the TU gets called. Andreas noted that CANCEL should not 
    contain content. Andreas noted that a dialog can change from client to
    server in the middle of the dialog (for example client sends a re-invite
    and puts caller on hold -- see sipping service examples draft). The
    RI was not allowing this. This was fixed and tested by Andreas.

<li> Antonis Karydas reported bugs in the implementation of the JAIN transaction
    model. Server transactions were being created with non-null TID
    on reciept of invites. Antonis reported that To/From headers should
    not be restricted only to use SIP urls. Antonis reported that 
    route sets were not properly maintained in the DialogImpl. Antonis
    reported that the DefaultRouterImplementation should be able to handle
    NON-SIP URLs. Antonis fixed a bug in Dialog.sendRequest() and 
    Dialog.createRequest(). Antonis reported several bugs in the strategy
    being used for dealing with ACKs for 4xx responses. Antonis reported
    a problem in handling Server transaction timeouts and posted a fix
    for this problem. Antonis reported a problem in content length for
    generation of responses. Antonis reported a problem with closely 
    spaced ACKs for CANCELed Server Transactions. Antonis reported that
    CANCEL after OK was not properly handled (stack should respond OK
    to cancel and not bother application.

<li> Beichuang reported bugs in the IM Client and presence server. BC also
    noted that extension methods were not working (Dialogs were not being 
    created).

<li> Steve Crossley reported bugs in the parser and setting local/remote party
     of dialog layer. Steve contributed a fix to the next hop determination
     in the Dialog code that could allow it to deal with legacy systems.
     Steve noticed that the short form of Refer-To was not supported in
     the parser. Steve noticed that null pointers were being generated
     when SessionDescriptionImpl was being cloned with null fields.
     Steve reported that content length was being set to 0 when the
     content of the SIP message is specified as an Object.

<li> Viswashanti Raj Kadiyala reported a bug and contributed a bug fix
     in the initialization of the tcp message channel. Shanti also
     reported a bug and contributed a bug fix for reciever tagging for
     Via headers.

<li> Andrew Prokop reported a bug in cloning of Authentication headers.

<li> Bob Johnson noticed documentation bugs.

<li> Mark Smith noticed that there were bugs in the handling of lr in the proxy.

<li> Tiago Dias (Altitude software) noticed that there was a bug with 
	subscribe/notify processing in the proxy. Tiago noticed that
	Notify processing in the proxy (presence extension) 
        was not returning final response immediately and contributed
	a bug fix for the proxy that rectified the problem.

<li> Roberto Tealdi reported a problem in instantiating multiple
	stacks in multi-homed hosts. 

<li> Laurent Schwitzer noticed that events were being dropped (not delivered
	to application) when request and response were closely spaced
	in time. Laurent noticed that the recieved parameter was not
	handling ipv6 address types.

<li> Stuart Woodsford (British Telecom) noticed a bug in the parsing of host 
	names when there are more than 3 components in the host name.

<li> Brian J. Collins discovered bugs in the implementation of SdpFactory.

<li> Dekeyzer Dmitri  noted that PRACK was not updating the Dialog 
      state and therefore route sets were not being applied appropriately.

<li> Willem Romijn AT&T corrected the payload type constant for H.263 codecs
	in SdpConstants.java

<li> Peter Parnes noted a bug in handling null messages. Null messages could
	be sent to keep alive firewall NAT mappings.

<li> Christophe noticed a bug in the transaction state machine when
	the retransmission filter is enabled. Christophe noted a bug in
	IOHandler when an IO Exception occurs while transmitting via TCP.
	Christophe noted a stack bug when IOException occurs (timer tick
	needs to be updated).


<li> Gareth Deli noticed a bug in TCP transport.

<p> Following is a list of people who contributed bugs reports and fixes to
NIST-SIP 1.1 (which implemented the JAIN SIP 1.0 interefaces). Many of
these fixes carry over to NIST-SIP 1.2 and hence their contributions
are acknowledged in rough chronological order of first contribution.

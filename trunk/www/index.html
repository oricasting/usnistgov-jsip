<head><title>JAVA API for SIP Signaling </title></head>
<BODY>
<p>
Contains RI, TCK, examples, tools for JAIN-SIP-1.2 
(JSR-32 maintenance release)  and an SDP library that conforms to the 
public release of  JSR 141 (JAIN-SDP) interfaces.  
JAIN-SIP RI is a full implementation of RFC 3261.
JAIN-SDP interfaces are still under public review and are subject to change.
Tools include a signaling trace viewer that can take input from an etherreal/stack trace. RI, TCK and tools are in the public domain.

<b> The best way to keep up to date with the latest source is to use cvs. 
To access cvs you need to join the project as an observer. </b> <br/>
<p>
<ul>
<li>
You need to join java.net first before you apply to the project for 
an observer role.  After your requested role is approved
check out the project from java.net using cvs.
<li> To check out the project from java.net use CVS :
<ul>
<li> CVS address is dev.java.net
<li> CVS Path is /cvs
<li> Module name is jain-sip
<li> CVS login and passsword is the same as your java.net login
</ul>
</ul>

<h2>Contribute</h2>
</div>

<p> You can contribute to this project by :

<ul>
<li> Using it in your product or project and providing feedback 
for the next version of JSIP.
<li> Fixing Bugs : export a 
diff listing from cvs, open an issue for the bug on java.net
and attach your suggested solution there.
You can discuss your bug on the NIST-SIP
mailing list or the JAIN-SIP project user list. 
<li>Reporting Bugs : To report a bug
provide a small self-contained example that illustrates the bug. You can
pattern the test case usually along the lines of examples/simplecallsetup. 
Having a test case handy speeds up the bug fix. Your test case 
will be included in the project as a test case.
Please enter an issue in the java.net issue tracker so other users
can know about the issue and its status. Please attach your test case
or bug description with debug log file there.
<li> Contributing Extensions and enhancements (i.e. support for SIP extension
RFCs and drafts that are not covered by JAIN-SIP): For this you need to 
discuss your planned contribution with the
project owners and sign up as a developer. <b> Note that there are no content 
developer roles for this project. Please discuss your planned contribution
with the owners before applying for a developer role. 
</b>
<li> Contributing code snippets and examples to be included 
with the distribution. </li>
<li> Contributing test cases to be included in the distribuiton. </li>
</ul>

Your contributions will be acknowledged individually in the code (as a 
comment) and in  <a href="README.html"> the acknowledgement page.</a>
If your bug fix or contriubution
is extensive, then mail the project owner and ask for a developer role so
you can commit the change yourself. Please run the ant <it> runtck </it> target
and make sure your bug fix does not break something else.

<li> The JAIN-SIP 1.2 RI offers you thread liveness monitoring features.
<li> The JAIN-SIP 1.2 RI offers you support for TLS accelerators and 
thread monitoring.
<li> The JAIN-SIP RI offers you IMS header support.
<li> The JAIN-SIP 1.2 API has been finalized and the change log is 
now up to date. 
<li> The TCK for JSIP-1.2 is Complete.
If you are implementing this specification,
you can test your implementation against the TCK 
<li>The stack performance measures in at 476 CAPS on a P5 dual core,
3.2 GHZ using TCP for transport. Using P4 3.2 GHZ single core with
hyperthreading and 2GB of RAM, a thruput of 267 CAPS has been reported.
On a dual core 3.4 Mhz P5 with 1 Gig RAM a thruput of 476 CAPS has been
reported.  Using UDP for transport, on a P4 single core, 2 GHZ machine
with 1 Gb of RAM and with no hyperthreading a a performance of 82 CAPS
was observed.  Using TCP for the same scenario, we measure in at 200
CAPS. Load tests were performed using test in test/load/concurrency. No
memory leaks were seen after 1000000 calls.  Thanks to Yanick Belanger
for several performance improvements and measurement.  </li>

<p> A usable subset of this project 
has been "ported" to j2me. Current work in progress includes 
adding interfaces to support JSR 180 (SIP For J2ME). 
However, the stack (without the JSR 180 interfaces)
is use-able as is. Join the  <br/>
<a href="http://sip-for-me.dev.java.net/"> sip-for-me </a>  project
on java.net as an observer to get the code from cvs on java.net.

<p>You can imbed the JAIN-SIP stack in an applet, HTTP servlet or an

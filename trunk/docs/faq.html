<h2>Frequently Asked questions </h2>
<ul>
 <li>Who owns NIST-SIP? <br/>
You! it is in the public domain. However, this only applies to
everything that was developed by us at NIST!   This includes the stack
(gov.nist....) the SDP implementation, the proxy, the trace viewer tool 
and IM client. 
When the TCK appears, it will also be open and in the public domain.
Specific copyrights apply everything else. These are noted in the code
and copyright statements included with the documents.   </li>

<li>What are the restrictions on its use? <br>
 Do whatever you want with it but just dont demand support. If you do use 
it in your product or project, be aware that it is experimental code and is
therefore subject to frequent changes.   Do acknowledge that your code was
derived from NIST-SIP. It helps us keep the project alive. </li>
<li>What is its intended use? <br/>
JAIN-SIP/ NIST-SIP is meant for SIP developers. 
As such it is not a stand-alone product.
Its primary use is for integrating SIP into your applications.  If you
have an applicaton already and wish to SIP-enable it, JAIN-SIP/NIST-SIP
is a reasonable choice.
</li>
<li>Show me a quick how-to <br/>
See examples/shootist
</li>
<li>Why is there only superficial resemblance between JAIN SIP 1.0  and
JAIN SIP 1.1?  
    <ul>
 <li>The previous API had a few problems.
These are documented in the JAIN-SIP-INTEREST
discussion list (ah! diplomacy!!).  </li>
 <li>The scope of the specification was made broader  (support for dialogs,
Routers, support for SIMPLE REFER etc.). </li>
 <li>The RFC changed a lot over between  2543 and 3261. </li>
 
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>How involved is it to port applications between JAIN-SIP 1.0 and  JAIN-SIP
1.1 <br>
 It is not difficult but it is not trivial. Anecdotal evidence indicates several
hours  or maybe a day or two of effort.  </li>
  <li> Is JAIN-SIP 1.1 Stateful/Stateless or DialogStateful <br>
 All of the above! You have the option to create a dialog for the first (dialog
creating) transaction. Once a dialog is created, however, all incoming requests
that belong to the dialog are automatically given a server transaction and
are hence handled statefully. </li>
  <li>Why does my application get null transaction ID for  INVITE transactions
?   <br>
 In order to support both  statefull and stateless modes of operation, the
INIVITE request gets delivered to your application with a null TID. You can
 choose to create a ServerTransacton and associated dialog using <it>provider.createNewServerTransaction(inviteRequest)</it>
  </li>
   <li>Who manages From/To tags   <br>
 From the client side, for the initial outgoing transaction,  the application
needs to specify a From tag. From the server side, the application specifies
the initial To tag when responding to the request. After that, the stack
manages things. Transactions are assigned to dialogs based on tags in requests/respomses.
  </li>
<li>Wy Dialog.sendRequest but no Dialog.sendResponse <br/>
 Dialog.sendRequest uses route set and other dialog specific information. 
Responses take all the information they need from the transaction.</li>
<li>Does the Softphone work on Linux?<br/>
Yes. You need a 2.4 Kernel and the latest version of the Java Media Framework.
<br>
</li>
<li>How do I cancel a transaction. <br>
<ul>
 <li> cancelreq = originalClientTransaction.createCancelRequest() </li>
      <li> ClientTransaction ct = sipProvider.getNewClientTransaction(cancelreq) 
      </li>
      <li> ct.sendRequest()</li>
    </ul>
 </li>

<li> What is the difference between Transaction.sendRequest,
Dialog.sendRequest and SipProvider.sendRequest <br/>
Dialog.sendRequest stamps the outgoing request with dialog state. This includes
the local sequence number, Request URI and Route set. For requests within
a dialog you should use Dialog.sendRequest. For sending request for a 
transaction that is not associated with a Dialog, you should use 
Transaction.sendRequest. For sending requests statelessly, you should use
SipProvider.sendRequest. Stateless requests do not result in the creation
of a new Transaction or Dialog.</li>

<li> What does the Router do? <br/>
The router routes requests outside a dialog. 
</li>

<li> How much backward compatibility with 2543 do you support <br/>
We do not guarantee complete backward compatibility with RFC 2543. We support
it to the extent that the implementation does not break. If there is a life
threatening conflict between RFC 2543 and RFC 3261, then RFC 3261 wins.
</li>

<li> What is the difference between Trasaction.sendAck 
and  Dialog.sendAck ? <br/>
The latter includes dialog state and places a fresh branch id in the Via.
This ensures it will not match any transaction on the server. Use this wen
ACKing 2xx responses and the former when ACKing error responses (407) 
and the like. </li>

<li> Why is there no Provider method for creating dialogs? <br/>
Dialog creation and destruction is managed by the stack. When the 
client transcaction is created, a Dialog is associated with it but
not mapped (its state is null). When you complete the transaction 
successfully it actually gets mapped and a valid state is assigned to it.
On the server side, when you get the request, provided the method of the
request has the ability to create a Dialog, you can elect to create a 
Dialog by creating a new Server Transaction at which point the stack
automatically creates a Dialog for transaction but defers actually mapping
it until a final response is sent out. </li>

<li>I am constructing a stateful proxy/B2BUA. I forward the request
after modifying it and then respond statefully. 
Why are the tags/headers/something else modified in the response ? <br/>
NIST-SIP does not copy the request when it hands it over to the listener. 
This is for efficiency. If you want to modify an outgoing request  (for example
if you are building a stateful proxy server or B2BUA)  clone it. JAIN-SIP
specifies a Deep cloning operation for this purpose.</li>

<li> How to set up messenger for SIP?<br/>
Enable communications services in Accounts tab. Go to Advanced and set your 
proxy from there.
</li>

<li>Does NIST-SIP do eager or lazy parsing? I see no parse exceptions on
get methods. What happened to all the JAIN SIP lazy parsing stuff? <br/>
The new JAIN Spec does not specify the type of parser to be employed. An
implementation may employ lazy parsing. Parse failures are silent. 
If  something
parsing fails then the header is silently added
to the uparseable header list and null is returned to the application.
The application can later retrieve it as a String as an Unparseable header.
This can happen either lazily or eagerly; however, Lazy/eager parsing is
not exposed at the API level. NIST-SIP employs an eager strategy (mostly
because of implementation ease). This is likely to be revised but your app
does not get affected. 
</li>

<li>What support is provided for sending out-of-dialog requests? <br/>
Use clientTransaction.sendRequest(). This will get the next hop from the
Router and use that to send the request. If you use dialog.sendRequest,
the next hop is obtained from the Dialog route set if one exists.
</li>

<li> How do I communicate with the Router from the application? </br>
This issue may arise when you want to use Loose or Strict routing. Only
the Application knows whether to use Loose or Strict Routing but the Router
needs to decide the Next Hops. Thus we need to communicate with the router.
Currently, it is a bit hacky. Use an extension header and place it in the
Request then examine it in the Router. For example, use a header like
IS-STRICT-ROUTE which the router will see as an extension header and strip 
off before deciding the next hop set.
</li>

<li> How are IO Exceptions reported to the Application? </br>
This case arises when using RETRANSMISSION FILTER.
Currently, IOExceptions will be reported to the application as a TIMEOUT
Event. This may change in the next revision where an explicit IOException 
Event may be included in the architecture to avoid overloading the semantics
of a TIMEOUT event.
</br>
<li> Why is the Transacton Request set to null? </br> The client
transaction is only obliged to hold a reference to the Request until the
transaction goes to COMPLETED state. After that, the reference to the
Request is nulled out to save heap space and ehance scalability of the
implementation. If you want to hold a long term reference to the request,
then please do this in your application.

<ul>

<li>Why is the version number of NIST-SIP 1.2 whereas JAIN-SIP 1.1  ? <br/>
Odd you should ask. The idea is to stay one step ahead.  </li>

<li>What is the [NIST/DOC/White House] position on SIP? 
<br/> 
If you have to ask, you are likely not to be a developer and NIST-SIP is
not for you. Direct such questions (in triplicate) to the Congressional
Sub-committee on SIP and other signaling protocols (or cat them 3 times
to dev/null if you prefer).
</li>

<li>Are you selling or buying something? <br/>
No and No - just making something. 
</li>

<li> Do you control government policy/procurement/purchasing? <br/> 
NO NO and NO </li>

<li><a href="http://www.advfilms.com/favorites/neoranga/main.html"> Who is Neo Ranga ? </a> <br/>
"Overall, Neo Ranga is a refreshing take on the giant monster genre,
more the story of why we feel the need for great gods who fight for
justice in a world where justice seems another commodity to be bought and
sold....Neo-Ranga himself is wonderful, fully expressing the sheer mass
and power he represents, while his thoughts and purpose are expressed
only in his eyes and actions....." [dvd review]

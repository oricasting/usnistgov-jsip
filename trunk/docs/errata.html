<h1> Spec documentation Errata </h1>

These errors and ommisions are to be corrected in a future maintenance release. 
They were discovered too late to be incorporated into the current release.
The RI does incorporate these assumptions.

<ul>
<li><it>javax.sip.message.SipRequest.clone() </it> The message contents are 
cloned as follows:
<ul>
<li> If the content is of type byte[] a new byte[] array is allocated and
the original contents are copied over to the cloned request. 
<li> If the content is of type String then a new String equal to the old
String is allocated and assigned to the cloned request.
<li> If the content is of type Object and it  has a public 
clone method then it is invoked and the resultant Object is used in the new
cloned SipRequest.
</ul>
<li><it>javax.sip.MessageFactory.createSipRequest(String ) </it> 
If the argument is null then an empty SipRequest is created. </li>
<li><it>javax.sip.Dialog.sendAck </it> is used for sending both ACK and
PRACK messages. </li>

<li><it>javax.sip.message.Message.getUnrecognizedHeaders </it>
Gets a ListIterator over all the UnrecognizedHeaders in this Message. Note
the order of the UnrecognizedHeaders in the ListIterator is the same as
order in which they appeared in the SIP Message. UnrecognizedHeaders are
headers that the underlying implementation does not recognize, a required
header (From, To, Call-ID, CSeq, Via) the entire message willl be dropped
by the underlying implementation and the header will not be included in
the list. Other headers that are part of the supported set of headers but
are not properly formatted will  be included in this list. Headers that
are not part of the supported set of headers are retrieved as Extension
headers. These must have a name:value format else they will be rejected
by the underling implementation and included in this list. A Proxy should
not delete UnrecognizedHeaders and should add these Headers to the end
of the header list of the Message that is being forwarded. A User Agent
may display these unrecognized headers to the user.
